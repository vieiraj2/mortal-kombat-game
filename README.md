# Java Mortal Kombat Game Simulation

The Mortal Kombat project aims to model all the characteristics of the world and the characters of the game Mortal Kombat X, developed by Warner Bros., 
Interactive and NetherRealm companies. The characters are divided into their respective classes and attributes, and are classified according to their 
characteristics.The software is able to insert, edit, remove and perform character searches. In addition, the software is able to simulate battles 
taking into account the individual abilities of each character (weapons attack). All information is saved to a particular remote database system in 
order to clearly organize the project data.
